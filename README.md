This is using some ugly JavaScript. So please don't use this as an example of how to do JavaScript. I'm figuring this stuff out as I go. I'm primarily a server side dev on C#.
 
#### Other project of note

There is another individual that has a project of Powershell cmdlets that you may also be interested in. Please note, I am not the author of that project.
